  # Student Grade Calculator

Welcome to the **Student Grade Calculator**! This Java program takes the marks obtained in various subjects, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage. It then displays the results to the user.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This program allows a user to:

- Input marks obtained in multiple subjects (out of 100).
- Calculate the total marks by summing up the individual subject marks.
- Calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
- Assign a grade based on the average percentage.
- Display the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core Java for input/output handling, arithmetic operations)

## 🎮 Features

- Input for marks in multiple subjects.
- Calculation of total marks and average percentage.
- Grade assignment based on the average percentage:
  - A+ for >= 90%
  - A for >= 80%
  - B+ for >= 70%
  - B for >= 60%
  - C for >= 50%
  - F for < 50%
- Display of results with total marks, average percentage, and grade.
