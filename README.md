# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! This is a console-based Java application where the player needs to guess a randomly generated number within a specific range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. You can play multiple rounds, and the game keeps track of your score (rounds won).

## 🚀 Project Overview

This game allows the user to:

- Guess a randomly generated number within a specified range (1 to 100).
- Receive feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Play multiple rounds with a limited number of attempts (10 attempts per round).
- Track the number of rounds won by the user.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core Java for input/output handling, random number generation)

## 🎮 Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100.
- User guesses a number and receives feedback: "Too low", "Too high", or "Correct".
- Limited number of attempts per round (10 attempts).
- Option to play multiple rounds.
- Score tracking (Rounds won).
- Clear and user-friendly text-based interface.

  # Student Grade Calculator

Welcome to the **Student Grade Calculator**! This Java program takes the marks obtained in various subjects, calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage. It then displays the results to the user.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This program allows a user to:

- Input marks obtained in multiple subjects (out of 100).
- Calculate the total marks by summing up the individual subject marks.
- Calculate the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects.
- Assign a grade based on the average percentage.
- Display the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java** (Core Java for input/output handling, arithmetic operations)

## 🎮 Features

- Input for marks in multiple subjects.
- Calculation of total marks and average percentage.
- Grade assignment based on the average percentage:
  - A+ for >= 90%
  - A for >= 80%
  - B+ for >= 70%
  - B for >= 60%
  - C for >= 50%
  - F for < 50%
- Display of results with total marks, average percentage, and grade.

This project implements a basic quiz game with the following features:

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions**: A list of quiz questions with multiple-choice options.
2. **Timer for Each Question**: A countdown timer for each question to limit answering time.
3. **Answer Submission**: The user can select an option and submit their answer.
4. **Score Calculation**: The system keeps track of correct answers and calculates the final score.
5. **Result Screen**: The final score is shown, along with feedback on performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: Used for implementing core logic, handling user input/output, and managing the quiz flow.
- **Scanner**: To take user input for answering questions.
- **TimeUnit**: For introducing pauses between questions.

## 🎮 Features

- **Timer**: Each question has a time limit of 10 seconds for answering.
- **Answer Submission**: The user selects an answer from multiple options.
- **Score Tracking**: The app tracks the number of correct answers and calculates the score at the end.
- **Final Result**: A summary of correct and incorrect answers is displayed after the quiz.
